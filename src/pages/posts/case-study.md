# Coffee recipe App

Published on: 24/11/2024

## Overview

Designing a coffee recipe tracking app that can store all variables for input and output of coffee. 

1. **Challenge**: Coffee nerds are obsessed with the quality and taste of the coffee brewed with various brew methods whether in their own home or where they work and tracking all the varibles is important in helping 'dial in' the perfect brew. As a self confessed coffee nerd I have been searching for a useful and easy to use app that lets me track my recipes. The big standout 'feature' of this app will need to be the ease of use as everything can become frustrating before the first coffee if not designed well.
Another key point to remeber is that this is a very niche target market; whilst a huge portion of people like coffee, only a small portion brew their own coffee at home. Further to that only a small portion of home brewers would care enough or have the right equipment to take advantage of tracking their brews and changing variables to dial in the taste.
So, easy to use whilst tired and lacking caffeine yet fully featured enough to tick all the boxes of the most particular coffee enthusiasts, should be easy to achieve right?

## User research

I am part of a number of facebook groups for coffee enthusiasts and assumed that I would be able to get some good information from those groups. I designed a survey form that I thought covered most bases and gave some fields that could be filled out if other info were to be added. Once I had posted them I waited a week and came back to **nothing**.
I can only assume that people are so wary of scams or clicking links OR simply don't want to spend the time to fill something like this out, even though it was only 5 questions. Perhaps the way that my post were worded didn't grab enough attention or instil a desire to fill out the form. either way it is a learing for next time to try something different.
As I am part of the target audience I decided instead of trying many different ways of getting data I would simply make some assumptions based on my use case and my experience with other brewing methods.

## Research findings (kind of)

My responses to the survey were
_Do you currently track your espresso shots through any form of media (this can be anything, physical notebook, app, note taking app, literally anything)?_ **No but would like to**
_If NO but would like to, what form of media would you prefer to use?_ **app**
_If you were to have an app to track your shots what variables would you track?_ **Dose weihgt, Water temp, Dose out weight, Brew time, Pre-infusion time, Tasting notes, WDT technique**
_If an app was made that perfectly fulfilled your personal preference for coffee tracking, would you use the same or similar app to track recipes for other things (cocktails, sauces, food recipes, etc)_  **Contained in the same app, but categorized for easy usage, yes**

The last question is _Any important considerations I have missed?_ which I think would be the most important part of the survey. As some background, I primarily brew espresso, but also have a moka pot and a filter brewer that I use from time to time. My filter brewer is a Hario switch which by itself has too many variations of brewing to count. Perhaps one very important consideration should be that I cannot know what variables people may want to track and therefore should try and stay away from hard coding those variables and let them be user determined. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## Personas and empathy maps

I wanted to create a few personas based on what I knew about other coffee users. Obviously I do not have hard data so I'm taking a few liberties here but by trying to create a few I would be helping myself to hopefully see what I may miss from my own poijnt of view.
_a small aside, I completely understand that due to not having data I am likely blind to other things that I do not know or points of view I may dismiss_
