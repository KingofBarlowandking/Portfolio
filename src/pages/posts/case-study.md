# Coffee recipe App

Published on: 24/11/2024

## Overview

Designing a coffee recipe tracking app that can store all variables for input and output of coffee. 

1. **Challenge**: Coffee nerds are obsessed with the quality and taste of the coffee brewed with various brew methods whether in their own home or where they work and tracking all the varibles is important in helping 'dial in' the perfect brew. As a self confessed coffee nerd I have been searching for a useful and easy to use app that lets me track my recipes. The big standout 'feature' of this app will need to be the ease of use as everything can become frustrating before the first coffee if not designed well.
Another key point to remeber is that this is a very niche target market; whilst a huge portion of people like coffee, only a small portion brew their own coffee at home. Further to that only a small portion of home brewers would care enough or have the right equipment to take advantage of tracking their brews and changing variables to dial in the taste.
So, easy to use whilst tired and lacking caffeine yet fully featured enough to tick all the boxes of the most particular coffee enthusiasts, should be easy to achieve right?

## User research

I am part of a number of facebook groups for coffee enthusiasts and assumed that I would be able to get some good information from those groups. I designed a survey form that I thought covered most bases and gave some fields that could be filled out if other info were to be added. Once I had posted them I waited a week and came back to **nothing**.
I can only assume that people are so wary of scams or clicking links OR simply don't want to spend the time to fill something like this out, even though it was only 5 questions. Perhaps the way that my post were worded didn't grab enough attention or instil a desire to fill out the form. either way it is a learing for next time to try something different.
As I am part of the target audience I decided instead of trying many different ways of getting data I would simply make some assumptions based on my use case and my experience with other brewing methods.

## Research findings (kind of)

My responses to the survey were
_Do you currently track your espresso shots through any form of media (this can be anything, physical notebook, app, note taking app, literally anything)?_ **No but would like to**
_If NO but would like to, what form of media would you prefer to use?_ **app**
_If you were to have an app to track your shots what variables would you track?_ **Dose weihgt, Water temp, Dose out weight, Brew time, Pre-infusion time, Tasting notes, WDT technique**
_If an app was made that perfectly fulfilled your personal preference for coffee tracking, would you use the same or similar app to track recipes for other things (cocktails, sauces, food recipes, etc)_  **Contained in the same app, but categorized for easy usage, yes**

The last question is _Any important considerations I have missed?_ which I think would be the most important part of the survey. As some background, I primarily brew espresso, but also have a moka pot and a filter brewer that I use from time to time. My filter brewer is a Hario switch which by itself has too many variations of brewing to count. Perhaps one very important consideration should be that I cannot know what variables people may want to track and therefore should try and stay away from hard coding those variables and let them be user determined. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## Personas and empathy maps

I wanted to create a few personas based on what I knew about other coffee users. Obviously I do not have hard data so I'm taking a few liberties here but by trying to create a few I would be helping myself to hopefully see what I may miss from my own point of view.
_a small aside, I completely understand that due to not having data I am likely blind to other things that I do not know or points of view I may dismiss_

## connoisseur cate 
wants to track everything so that he can get the absolute best shot possible, tweaks the smallest details. spends alot on equipment and beans. not constrained by cost but that doesn't mean they want to waste the coffee they get. doesn't just consume coffee as drink, will carve out time to invest in trying new beans and techniques. will work around quirks if that technology or equipment is worth it  but also believes that good and expensive things are frictionless and intuitive to use. will rant about issues with a product more if it is extremely good but a few things let it down.
## casual enthusiast ethan 
often time poor but sometimes will make time to spend time on the hobby of coffee. most of the coffee they drink is made quickly in the morning before work or going to do something. Knows what good coffee tastes like and wants every shot to be as close as possible to perfect without huge amounts of effort. often buys the same beans and when doing so wants to dial in immediately to a good cup. sometimes gets fancy and different beans and does their best to dial in to the tastiest shot possible. any technology or equipment has to be easy to use as it will probably be used early in the morning without much time.
## new to the hobby nathan
still investigating the hobby and getting interested. still building knowledge but seems to be getting better tasting coffee everytime they try something new. due to the newness to coffee can be confused by the equipment or technology and terminology, needs things to be easy to use and intuitive.
## all the toys alex
has every different brewer under the sun and picks one based on what they feel like. can guess pretty well what variables are going to look like for a new bean on a brew method due to wide experience. keeps lots of specialty coffee and changes daily based on what taste they want that day. can use almost any technology and will find the cool factor in something even if it isn't the easiest to use. Only really graabs what is really good and without flaws when brewing daily though. any new technology or equipment needs to enhance the experience or it will become a show piece, unused regularly.
