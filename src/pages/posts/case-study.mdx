## Designing a coffee recipe tracking app and all the pitfalls along the way.

<img src="/phoneMockupEspressoApp.png" alt="Mockup for coffee tracking app" class="markdown-image"/>

_A first draft_ 

**Challenge**: Coffee nerds are obsessed with the quality and taste of the coffee brewed with various brew methods whether in their own home or where they work and tracking all the varibles is important in helping 'dial in' the perfect brew. As a self confessed coffee nerd I have been searching for a useful and easy to use app that lets me track my recipes. 

The big standout 'feature' of this app will need to be the ease of use as everything can become frustrating before the first coffee if not designed well.
Another key point to remember is that this is a very niche target market; whilst a huge portion of people like coffee, only a small portion brew their own coffee at home. Further to that only a small portion of home brewers would care enough or have the right equipment to take advantage of tracking their brews and changing variables to dial in the taste.
So, easy to use whilst tired and lacking caffeine yet fully featured enough to tick all the boxes of the most particular coffee enthusiasts, should be easy to achieve right?

## User research

I am part of a number of facebook groups for coffee enthusiasts and assumed that I would be able to get some good information from those groups. I designed a survey form that I thought covered most bases and gave some fields that could be filled out if other info were to be added. Once I had posted them I waited a week and came back to **nothing**.

I can only assume that people are so wary of scams or clicking links OR simply don't want to spend the time to fill something like this out, even though it was only 5 questions. Perhaps the way that my post were worded didn't grab enough attention or instill a desire to fill out the form. either way it is a learing for next time to try something different.
As I am part of the target audience I decided instead of trying many different ways of getting data I would simply make some assumptions based on my use case and my experience with other brewing methods.

## Research findings (kind of)

My responses to the survey were

_Do you currently track your espresso shots through any form of media (this can be anything, physical notebook, app, note taking app, literally anything)?_ **No but would like to**

_If NO but would like to, what form of media would you prefer to use?_ **App**

_If you were to have an app to track your shots what variables would you track?_ **Dose weight, Water temp, Dose out weight, Brew time, Pre-infusion time, Tasting notes, WDT technique**

_If an app was made that perfectly fulfilled your personal preference for coffee tracking, would you use the same or similar app to track recipes for other things (cocktails, sauces, food recipes, etc)_  **Contained in the same app, but categorized for easy usage, yes**


The last question is _Any important considerations I have missed?_ which I think would be the most important part of the survey. As some background, I primarily brew espresso, but also have a moka pot and a filter brewer that I use from time to time. My filter brewer is a Hario switch which by itself has too many variations of brewing to count. Perhaps one very important consideration should be that I cannot know what variables people may want to track and therefore should try and stay away from hard coding those variables and let them be user determined. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## Personas

I wanted to create a few personas based on what I knew about other coffee users. Obviously I do not have hard data so I'm taking a few liberties here but by trying to create a few I would be helping myself to hopefully see what I may miss from my own point of view. I had originally thought of making empathy maps for the personas as well but after doing one found it a little useless as the personas are based entirely off my interpretation and thus don't really add anything that isn't in the persona's. Unfortunately this is yet another reason why hard data is invaluable and why this approach of using my own understanding of coffee users will likely be flawed. But I'm working with what I've got. Consider it a cautionary tale. 

_A small aside, I completely understand that due to not having data I am likely blind to other things that I do not know or points of view I may dismiss._

    { src: "/personaAlex.png", alt: "Alex" },
    { src: "/personaCate.png", alt: "Cate" },
  ]}
/>

Based on these personas we can start to create some ideas on what this app needs to include and how it needs to work. Some key things might be 
* App opens directly onto new brew page or last brew page, common among the personas was ease of use, straight to the point and ability to recall past data
* Many variables being able to be tracked and even the ability to add personal variables, not only will this help with capturing any amount of variables that the user wants but will also mean users like Nathan will be able to create variables that make sense to them especially if the names of preset ones don't make sense to that user
* Descriptions of any hard coded variables to help users understand what they are tracking
* Easy access to recall past brews, perhaps this can even be in a graph form showing a variable so the user can learn trends and pick out brews based on a specific target they're looking for. This should also be easily determinable by brewing type \(espresso, pour over, etc\)


I had intended to do sitemaps and userflows as the next step but I had a bit of a break between moving house, christmas and new years where I had this case study bouncing around my head a little. 
I came up with a few ideas of how the app might function or look and because of this and not knowing exactly which direction I wanted to take I landed on needing to do some hand drawn low fidelity first to get an idea of what features I would be actually prototyping. I wanted to fully flesh out
the entirety of the app instead of pushing the scope after making the sitemaps and user flows.

My initial idea was to do something basic like the first draft I quickly mocked up. The main benefit is having all of the available information at a glance, perfect for experienced users who want that data quickly. A downside I realized was that if the variables are to be
able to be user defined and not limiting the amount available on the page then the benefit could be quickly diminished whether thats from readability or size of the information on screen or due to the need to scroll. I don't have an idea that addresses this yet.

Another Idea I had thought of was using simple language to describe the brew. This may be a little easier for attracting newer and less experienced coffee enthusiasts as it would help make sense of what the data is actually being used for. For example if the variable a user were tracking were
dose in, dose out, water temp, brew time, preinfusion, brew type, beans and flavor notes, the screen would display **I brewed 40g of espresso with 20g of the roastville whitehouse blend with 93C water and it brewed for 40 secs with 10 secs of preinfusion. It was nutty, chocolatey and I will grind slightly coarser next time.**
with the input variables being blank or prefilled with the last brew and the those variable being highlighted in some way. This could also be combined with the first idea, have the majority of the variables in simple text and then whatever variables the user wants as simple displays.

Neither of these address my desire to try and have all the information available on a single page but depending on the amount of variables this may not be feasible and maybe instead I should be focused on giving the user control over what is on the page and what isn't. Maybe a simple 
solution is that when the user adds variable they put them in a ordered list with a line at one point of the list showing what will need to be scrolled to. Assuming as well that the designs of the first idea ( we will call it the 'block variables' from now on) and the simple text idea both
feel good I would like to give the user the ability to use either one or a combination of the 2. This obviously adds scope to the design but may be worth it if it will attract and keep more users.

    { src: "/sketchs2.jpg", alt: "sketch" },
    { src: "/sketchs3.jpg", alt: "sketch" },
  ]}
/>

So my hand drawn prototypes brought me to a few possible outcomes, the block variables version, the mixed simple language and another idea that came to me while drawing, of having a diagram to represent the variables, so for an espresso brew, there would be an exploded view showing 
the grinder, the top of the machine, the portafilter then finally the cup with coffee with lines pointing to each part of the machine. I iterated on the block variables a few times and came up with something to do a low fidelity design from, the mixed simple language version
I need to prototype to make sure its crossed off but the exploded view I came to the conclusion that it is missing the point of the app a little and whilst would look cool, especially if it was animated, would make the design harder to use and possibly off putting
for users in typical usecase. 

I read an article a little while ago called 'Stop wireframing (but start low fidelity)' and after my iterations with these designs I think the basis of the arguments made in that article make sense to me. Across my 4 sketchs for the block variables the biggest change was 
adding In and Out tags to represent what parts of the brews were being talked about and the hierarchy based on that and whether a variable is likely to change often or not. If I had only wireframed I don't believe I would have made it to that conclusion until low fidelity
designs which may have made me change the idea and I would have spent time designing things that weren't as high quality. **I understand that I am new to the industry and this also might not be the case for every project so I am not making my mind up and am simply keeping an open
mind to other ways of doing things that may be faster and more effective.**

The mixed simple language version hasn't shown me potential yet and I'm thinking it may fall into the same group as the illustration view where it displays the data in a less user friendly when tired or not focused way than possible. 

So with those sketchs done I went and did some low fidelity prototypes based on them.

I tried 3 sort of versions as shown below of the basic idea of block variables and incorporating the natural language into it (ignore the colour differences across the three I was just trying some functions out). The second prototype with the natural language feels empty
but also when running through the use of it feels like it misses the point, typing up a coherent reference to the brew at 5am doesn't appeal to me. The third screen was an experiment with keeping labels on the variables as it could be confusing to look at a bunch of numbers 
without much reference but I decided that with the number of variables that are likely to be tracked this would lead to not enough space on the page and the labelling and readability can be solved other ways.

I decided that this was about as far as I wanted to iterate on this design for the moment, things may change as it gets higher fidelity but for now the layout feels user friendly and ticks the boxes it needs to. Some key things that I have considered about the design are
* The hierarchy of the variables, starting at the top being the least likely to change on a day to day basis through the bottom (the easiest for a thumb to reach) being the most likely to change
* The variable blocks themselves being the buttons make them easy to hit
* The variables start with variable name and then transition to having a label above the block to provide clarity. If the app is to open on the last brew this is particularly important as it allows the user to get key info on how to brew immediately

These are the screens showing what a blank brew page and filled brew page would look like

    { src: "/lowFidMainPage.png", alt: "low fidelity proto of main page" },

/>

Next up I prototyped a couple of edit variable pages. Key functions here are adding new variables and the arrow key allowing for the variable to expand and show more information.

    { src: "/lowFidVariables.png", alt: "low fidelity proto of edit variables" },
  ]}
/>

 And lastly a historical view of brews. This idea is probably the 2nd most important behind the core function of inputting the brew as this allows you to see correlations between changes in variables and taste. The coffee community is for the most part using the same 
 brew methods as it is not an easy thing to experiment with different brew times or doses etc especially when considering individual differences in equipment. This historical and graph functions may allow more people to try different ways of brewing.

    { src: "/lowFidHistorical.png", alt: "low fidelity proto of historical page" },
  ]}
/>

With those low fidelity prototypes done it is now time to try and gather some feedback on the design. I only know one person who takes their brewing serious enough to make use of something like this so I am going to try and 
gather some feedback again from facebook groups, hopefully with the visual nature of this that will be a little easier to grab attention and actually get people involved. From that feedback I will iterate on the designs if they need and then move into 
fine tuning and creating high fidelity versions.

I went back to facebook to ask for feedback for the low fidelity prototypes I had created and had a much better experience this time around. 
The first post I made I got a response from someone familiar with design and they suggested looking at Typeform and how they handle data input on
individual pages. This would also allow for a twist on the idea of having a diagram or animation showing what the current page is referring to. Main benefit
to this approach would be simplifying the experience, particularly when tired or juggling a portafilter, grinds cup and milk jug in a way that requires
less mental input for finding which variable button is needed to be pressed. Flow of the app might now work like this
* App still opens on an overview, being able to view the data at a glance is still important.
* Pressing new brew take you to a screen that has one of 2 things on it, either confirms existing input variables and asks whether they are correct before moving on
or resets the data and allows you to input the 'In' portion of the the brew before pressing a ready to brew button which moves into time input (for espresso at least)
* each page would then be a single data input with a single large button at the bottom of the screen to move to the next variable 
* after all the pages have been stepped through the app would then display the data as the overview.

Something interesting about this is it would also allow for a timer page to be displayed so instead of typing in the time for the brew there could be
three buttons (for espresso) one for start preinfusion, the next full pressure and finally a stop and this would capture both preinfusion time and brew time
with 3 taps instead of 8, assuming both numbers are double digits. A simple plus and minus button could also be added in case the button press on screen
is not directly in line with pressing stop on the machine. 

I will prototype some screens to get an idea of how it should look then I think my focus should be on building into an interactive prototype to really show how the app will function. 

This is the design taking the approach similar to typeform and having each page as a data entry. Starts off as something similar to the original design
but with the choice to keep inputs or reset them.

We then move into the use case of the user wanting to reset and reenter the input parameters for brewing, likely say if they were using a different bean
or a different machine.

And now the use case of a user wanting to keep the entered parameters for cases where they are using the same machine and beans.
