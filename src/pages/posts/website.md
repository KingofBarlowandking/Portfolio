## This website was coded by me from scratch.

As part of one of my final subjects at uni, we were tasked with creating a portfolio. A website was highly encouraged but tools such as wordpress were suggested for non web dev students. I chose to challenge myself and build some new skills by coding this from scratch.

This site uses the Astro framework and features resuable React components for greater ease of editing and expanding down the road. I do not claim to be an expert in these but am slowly building my skills and capabilities alongside design work.

You can view the files for this site on Github.
