I recently read an article from a designer **insert** talking about the lack of benefits of wireframing. As a new designer this immedietly made sense as low fidelity is about as easy as wireframing but can give you better understanding of how the visual design, colours and icons will work together. I decided I would do a bit of a challenge to test the theory and confirm or deny my thoughts on this type of practice.

I'm currently at the wireframe/low fidelity stage of my case study into building a coffee tracking app and after some thoughts and use of my portfolio site I decided I want to seek some feedback and do a case study on that to sharpen its focus for hopefully landing me a job. What I propose to myself is that my coffee app design will go
- UX state outline - fast ability to get on paper what needs to be on the page
- whiteboard/paper sketch
- low fidelity - with properly chosen graphics, colours, icons and text or multiple with variations on those things to see if they make the layout feel good or bad

and the portfolio site would go
- whiteboard/paper sketch
- wireframe
- low fidelity

Hoping to find out what is more intuitive adn what produces a more final design in less time.
